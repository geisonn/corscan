# corscan
Corscan is a Go-based tool that automates the detection and exploitation of CORS misconfigurations. It performs intelligent analysis of Access-Control-Allow-Origin behavior, detects credentialed cross-origin access, and generates PoCs automatically â€” streamlining CORS testing for bug bounty and offensive security workflows.
